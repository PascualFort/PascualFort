- 👋 Hi, I’m @PascualFort
- 👀 I’m working as a Freelance FullStack Developer.  
- 🌱 I work with the following codes:
  HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, PHP, MySQL, Python, Java, Dart (Flutter), AngularJS (Obsolete.. I could learn Angular 13), NodeJS, among others.
- :pencil2: I'm currently learning Firebase, XML (XSD, DTDs) and enforcing my skills on my regular codes every day.
- 💞️ Right now, I’m looking to collaborate on PHP modular project builds, a 3D modeling software, or any other interesting project.
